I am delighted taking all the three points needed from the match. Also, it is not what we expected because we were supposed to score three or four goals in the match but we could not as we threw our chances away. I do not feel good winning with one goal against Bukola Babes as we wanted to welcome them to the Premier League with at least three to four goals. We had a poor start this season because we lost some of our key players at the end of last season. We have managed to put a new team in place with relatively unknown players which at the moment have picked form and can compete with any team in the continent and the league.
